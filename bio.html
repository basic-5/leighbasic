<p>Hello, my name is Leigh. I'm an old women in her 30s who is studying I.T. at uni in Australia; online. 
</p>
<p>I've made it through the first year of study, and now I'm trying to push myself a little 
  further.
  </p>
  <p>
  This learning journal is an attempt to increase my skills by creating a project for myself
  every week based on my learning material. As a full-time student, I am studying 2
  subjects per study block. So I'll be producing 2 mini-projects/week.

<br>
<p>a little bit about me... I was not someone who 'grew up with computers' 
   - though I did recently install dosbox and 
  the games gave me insane flashbacks
  to a period in my life I had no idea still lived in my head. I have a degree in music,
  I enjoy the horror genre and hobbies revolving around crafting. I am generally
  a skeptical person, but I frequently entertain the possibility that
  ghosts and fairies might actually exist.
  And, when I started learning HTML 2 years ago my socks were blown right off.

</p>
<p>It's been a pretty steep learning curve, but I have become quite enamoured with computers and
  programming and its etceteras. 
</p>
<p>I'll probably come back and edit this later. I just wanted to get this website up and running,
  because I tend to procrastinate on these things. 
</p>

<p>Anyway, love you! BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
